# Python Developer Assessment

## Overview
This project demonstrates core Python skills including code style, data structures, OOP, error handling, and API interaction.

## Completed Tasks
[Task 1.3 – Code Style & Linting](bad_style.py)
[Task 2.1 – Data Structures & Algorithms](dsa_challenges.py)
[Task 2.2 – Object-Oriented Programming](book_store.py)
[Task 2.3 – Debugging & Error Handling](debug_errors.py)
[Task 3.1 – API Interaction](api_client.py)

## Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed.
2. Install required packages: pip install black flake8 requests.
3. Run any script with: python <filename>.py.

## Reflections
**Challenges:** Handling merge conflicts, debugging empty list errors, and learning API requests.
**Interesting:** Using OOP to model real-world objects (Book class) and handling exceptions gracefully.
**Learning:** Improved understanding of Python error handling, API usage, and Git workflows.
